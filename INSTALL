To run the artifact, the followings are required:

- Python version 3 or newer: https://www.python.org/downloads/

- Utilities: parallel, make

    Use the following command to install these utilities.

    * Ubuntu
    
      $sudo apt update && apt install parallel make -y
    
    * MacOS

      $brew install parallel make

To install our artifact, follow the below instruction steps:

1. Run 'make' at the top directory:

  - ~/tee-formal-spec$ make
  
2. Use the following command to run smoke tests for our installation:
  
  - ~/tee-formal-spec$ make test

  This command requires sudo permission.

3. If the tests succeed, you will see the following messages:

  start smoke test ...
  [exec] Python: pass
  [exec] GNU-Parallel: pass
  [exec] Maude:
    ./tests/maude/01.maude: pass
    ./tests/maude/02.maude: pass
    ./tests/maude/03.maude: pass
    ./tests/maude/04.maude: pass

Remark: On macOS, the Mac system may block the Maude executable. To resolve this issue, navigate 
to the settings > security & privacy tab and grant permission to the Maude executable.
